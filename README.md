<pr>
PassLock is a password manager and generator that encrypts passwords using AES and saves them securely on your local machine. The password is encrypted and decrypted using a user-defined key and will get updated in each use. Extending the length of the private key will steadily improve the overall security. PassLock also generates a 40-bit password consisting of lowercase, and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols Passlock's 220-bit AES encryption and infinitely long password generator make your passwords nearly impossible to break. Its Console-Based User Interface will help to enhance your experience.
